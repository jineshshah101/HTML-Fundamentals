<!-- Forms are a good way to have different things that need to be submitted-->
<!-- Example would be facebook, things to put it would be log in credentials and then you click submit to go to home page-->
<!-- Forms deal alot with the server side but since this is html we will not go into too much detail about it-->
<!-- action is pretty much what web address you want to put in-->
<!-- "/" means it's the index page aka the home page-->
<!-- get method means in a sense it takes in login information/request parameter-->
<!-- post method means in a sense it takes in a huge body of text information-->
<!-- div tag is a better way to organize things-->
<!-- label tag is what title you want the label to be, like if someone wants to put in name information then the label is name-->
<!-- input tag is the area where the user can type in the information they need to type in-->
<!-- name label means it looks for a name-->
<!-- email label means it looks for a email address-->
<!-- input type submit is where you would make a submit button to send information-->
